# mapggm: Multi-attribute perturbed Gaussian graphical models (R package)

This repository contains an R package with methods used in ``Detection of multiple perturbations in multi-omics biological networks'' (Griffin, Johnson, & Kolaczyk; under revision).
Functions are provided for multi-attribute network estimation and perturbation detection under a joint Gaussian graphical model.
To use this package, install the devtools package from CRAN and run: 

	library(devtools)
	install_github('paulajgriffin/mapggm')

For the simulation pipeline files and TCGA data used in this paper, please see <https://github.com/KolaczykResearch/mapggm_supplemental>.
